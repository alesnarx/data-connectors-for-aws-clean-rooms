## Databrew recipe samples

In DataBrew, a recipe is a set of data transformation steps. You can apply these steps to a sample of your data, or apply that same recipe to a dataset.   
Even if you're not a programmer, it's helpful to understand the structure of a recipe and how DataBrew organizes the recipe actions.

The examples present in these folders serve as a quick reference and a guidance on how to construct databrew recipe steps.       
The folder names indicate the type of transformation step applied to the original dataset.  

The folder contents are organized as follows:    
- Sample data
- Recipe step in json file format 
- Transformed data after the application of the recipe step 

Additionally there is also 1 complete recipe file (transform-sample-recipe.json) containing multiple steps.

You can start building your recipe by adding data transformations to the source columns of your dataset.
